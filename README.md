# KNN-Implementation
A Java implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm that will evaluate and classify a wine dataset.

The current version of this classifier produces an accuracy percentage of 34.83%, which indicates that further work is needed to be made in order to provide a higher classification accuracy.

### Run:


1. Firstly, import the compile and run the K_NearestNeighbour.java file in order run the classifier.

2. You will be prompted to type in the training dataset filename and test dataset filename.

3. For the training dataset filename, type in       
        
    `wine-training.txt`

4. For the test dataset filename, type in          

    `wine-test.txt`

5. The program will then run accordingly and print the new test class labels and classification accuracy.

6. The program will also create and output file called      
   
   `sampleoutput.txt`
